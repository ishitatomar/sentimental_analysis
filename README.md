Sentimental analysis is the process of extracting conclusions from the opinions of the people on a particular topic. People around the world are connected to each other through an enormous network of social networking sites such as Facebook, Instagram, twitter and some more.

Here, I have performed sentimental analysis on a dataset acquired from Kaggle which contains tweets expressing the depression level of the people (0 for low and 1 for high) with the help of some wrapper and filter-based bio-inspired algorithms viz. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) and Naive Bayes Classification and Logistic Regression.

These models were used to analyze the public opinions by comparing their accuracy to each other along with scatter plot.

Objective of the project is to extract tweets from twitter and extract sentiments out of them and develop a sentimental analysis system using Bio inspired Algorithms using PSO and GWO and various other algorithms to optimize the parameters of various machine learning classifier. The system will analyse text and data and classify it a positive, negative or neutral based on its sentiment.

Developing a sentimental analysis model using Bio inspired Algorithms, utilizing some machine learning algorithms as the base model and optimizing its parameters using PSO and GWO and other bio inspired algorithms with the help of python as the programming language.
